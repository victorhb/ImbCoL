\item{x}{A data.frame contained only the input attributes.}

\item{y}{A factor response vector with one label for each row/component of x.}

\item{measures}{A list of measures names or \code{"all"} to include all them.}

\value{
A list named by the requested linearity measure.

\description{
Classification task. The linearity measures try to quantify if it is possible
to separate the classes by a hyperplane. The underlying assumption is that a 
linearly separable problem can be considered simpler than a problem requiring
a non-linear decision boundary.
}
\details{
The following measures are allowed for this method:
 \describe{
   \item{"L1"}{Sum of the error distance by linear programming (L1) computes 
     the sum of the distances of incorrectly classified examples to a linear 
     boundary used in their classification.}
   \item{"L2"}{Error rate of linear classifier (L2) computes the error rate 
     of the linear SVM classifier induced from dataset.}
   \item{"L3"}{Non-linearity of a linear classifier (L3) creates a new 
     dataset randomly interpolating pairs of training examples of the same 
     class and then induce a linear SVM on the original data and measure 
     the error rate in the new data points.}
   \item{"LX_partial"}{X in [1,2,3]. It is the decomposed version of the 
     correponding LX function. Instead of giving a single complexity value 
     for the dataset, it returns one complexity value per class.}
